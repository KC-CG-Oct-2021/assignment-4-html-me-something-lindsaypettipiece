      <p>This is where I come into the picture! I was born February 8th, 1985 in Santa Clara, California. I had one older brother, your Uncle Bryan. We grew up in Fremont, Californian and had many great adventures as a family.
      </p>
      <p>Many years later I decided to go on a new adventure all by myself to Kansas City, Missouri! This adventure would give me so much more then I could ever ask for. This adventure is the adventure that gave me you!</p>
